# Multi-Signature Wallet implementation
This is an implementation of a multi signature wallet. A wallet that allows several owners and requires that a certain number of owners sign the transaction before it's executed. It also has a transaction limit feature.

> Note: This wallet is experimental but it's built using the latest solidity syntax and design guidelines

This project is built with reference to ConsenSys [multi-sig wallet implementation](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet/blob/ca981359cf5acd6a1f9db18e44777e45027df5e0/contracts).

This implementation is just for education but if you find it useful in your project, feel free to use it and if you discover errors in the code, please create an issue as that can enable me fix them as well as learn from my mistakes. Enjoy
